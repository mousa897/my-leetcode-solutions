// Question:
// Given a function fn, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures fn is called at most once.

// The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as fn.
// Every subsequent time it is called, it should return undefined.

// Solution:
var once = function (fn) {
  let hasBeenCalled = false;
  return function (...args) {
    if (hasBeenCalled === false) {
      hasBeenCalled = true;
      return fn(...args);
    } else {
      return undefined;
    }
  };
};
